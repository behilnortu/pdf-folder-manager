# How to Add Topics/Tags to Your GitHub Repository

Topics help people discover your repository when searching GitHub. Follow these steps:

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to your repository:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/behilnortu/pdf-folder-manager

2. **Click on the settings gear icon:**
   - Look for the ⚙️ gear icon next to "About" section (top right of the main page)
   - If you don't see "About", click "Add description" first

3. **Add Topics:**
   - Click on the ⚙️ gear icon next to "About"
   - In the "Topics" field, add the following tags (press Enter after each):

## Recommended Topics for Your Project:

```
pdf
pdf-viewer
pdf-manager
document-management
file-manager
nodejs
express
javascript
web-app
real-time
file-upload
search
chokidar
multer
pdf-organizer
document-viewer
folder-management
```

## Additional Recommended Topics:

```
automation
web-application
pdf-tools
document-organizer
file-monitoring
responsive-design
vanilla-javascript
```

4. **Add a Description:**
   - In the same dialog, add a short description:
   ```
   🗂️ Web-based PDF management system with search, upload, and real-time monitoring. Three-column layout for easy navigation.
   ```

5. **Add Website (optional):**
   - If you deploy this somewhere, add the URL
   - For now, you can leave it blank or add the GitHub Pages URL if you set it up

6. **Click "Save changes"**

## Why Topics Matter:

- **Discoverability**: People can find your project when searching for related topics
- **Categorization**: GitHub uses topics to categorize and recommend projects
- **SEO**: Improves search engine visibility
- **Community**: Helps connect your project with similar projects

## Best Practices:

- Use 5-15 topics (most relevant ones)
- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens for multi-word topics (e.g., `pdf-viewer` not `pdf viewer`)
- Include technology stack (nodejs, express, javascript)
- Include functionality (search, upload, real-time)
- Include use cases (document-management, file-manager)

Once you've added topics, your repository will be much easier to discover!
